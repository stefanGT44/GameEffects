# GameEffects

## Overview
A 2D game showcasing some simple computer graphics effects and techniques, developed from scratch, with very basic gameplay.

#### Some of the techniques being used:
* Particle effects
* Linear interpolation for gradients (health bar)
* Eliptical trajectory with alpha and size scaling to mimic 3d rotation
* Image looping (infinite scrolling of an image)
* Sprite animations
* Scrolling battle text (damage)
* Layer masks
